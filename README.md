# Birds-watching

I worked with a team of three people on an image recognition task in order to identify bird species using a dataset which includes 200 categories of bird species and 11,788 images. For our analysis, we trained a deep learning model using the convolution neural network and a specific transfer learning method called feature extraction. Subsequently, we analyzed the modelâ€™s performance by using accuracy and top-k accuracy as metrics.
